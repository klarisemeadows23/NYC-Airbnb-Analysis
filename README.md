# NYC_Airbnb_Analysis
This project analyzes Airbnb rental data for Manhattan to help an investment-focused client determine which neighborhoods and property types offer the highest earning potential. Using raw Airbnb listing and revenue data, this analysis identifies top-performing neighborhoods, optimal listing size by number of bedrooms, and potential yearly revenue for top listings. The report also provides data-driven insight and recommendations for the client.

This project demonstrates my ability to utilized advance spreadsheet techniques to clense and translate raw data into clear insights, build a narrative around data trends, and provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders.
